# Sidebar-1

A sidebar is a vertical column or panel typically located at the side of a graphical user interface (GUI), website, or application. It often contains navigational links, menus, or supplementary information that remains accessible while the main content of the interface is displayed. Sidebars can provide quick access to important features, settings, or additional content without cluttering the main display area. They are commonly used in web design, software applications, and content management systems to enhance user experience and facilitate navigation.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Run the application with the command `npm start`.
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
